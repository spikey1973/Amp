this is a program to be! and is not ready yet and will not be for a long time. 

it's function is to do the following.  

via a arduino mega board control fan speed and RGB led controller by a measured and averaged temperature 

this program to be is meant to do this by the following step. 
1) measure temperatures via 9 pcs of LM35
2) calculate a running average over 10 measurements of each. 
3) calculate a weighted average over these 9 running averages
4) use this value to determine the needed fan speed 
5) set the colour of the ledstrips (white or blue as save, red as hot)

anyone reading this and that is willing to voluntarily contribute.
please contact me.
